# Rule: Linear Issue Creation Guide

## Description
This rule provides a structured template for creating well-defined Feature or Task Issues in Linear. Use this rule when you need to define a new piece of work for the project.

## Workflow

When invoked, the AI will guide the user through the following steps to gather all necessary information.

### Step 1: Define the Core Task

The AI will ask for the following essential information:
1.  **Issue Title:** A concise, descriptive title for the task (e.g., "Implement User Profile Page").
2.  **Issue Type:** Is this a `Feature`, `Bug`, `Chore`, or `Refactor`?
3.  **Priority:** `High`, `Medium`, `Low`, or `No Priority`.

### Step 2: Write the Issue Description using the Template

The AI will then use the gathered information to populate the following Markdown template. The user should fill in the details for each section.

**I want to** [Perform an action],
**So that I can** [Achieve a benefit].
